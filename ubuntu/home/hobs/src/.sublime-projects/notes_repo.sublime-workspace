			"contents": "1. Please explain why you would like to be a judge for the Google Lunar XPRIZE.\n\n\"To boldly go where no [one] has gone before\" is human destiny and my goal in life. Although I accomplished much for robotic space exploration as an aerospace government contractor for the majority of my career, I recognize that private entrepreneureal businesses should lead the development of future technologies and business approaches that will sustain space exploration into the future. As a judge my goal will be to ensure that the competitive playing field is as level as possible for the intrepid teams staking a large portion of their financial security and professional reputation on these bold efforts to advance human progress in space. Only with impartial, inciteful, and open-minded administration and judgement can the forward-thinking leadership of XPRIZE foundation be rewarded with long term progress in space exploration and technological advancement.\n\nI look forward to the possability of having a front row seat as the teams share ideas and stories of progress in their quest to build sustainable aerospace companies that can affordably send robotic systems into space and retrieve valuable scientific data and commercially valuable entertainment media back to Earth. As a judge I would have the unique oportunity to interract with the most daring and altruistic of the technology, business, and space explorers leading the way forward for the rest of human society.\n\n2. Please describe how your background makes you an ideal candidate for this opportunity? Please give specific examples.\n\nThe breadth and depth of my expertise in the technologies required for robotic space exploration will be difficult to find in another candidate. I have invented, designed, or managed programs to build aerospace systems as diverse as laser communication terminals, control moment gyroscopes, robotic space walking systems (AWIMR), formation flying and docking spacecraft, and innovative propulsion systems (4 patents, 2 patent applications, numerous trade secret and company innovation awards). My resume speaks for itself in aerospace technology development accomplishments. \n\nIn addition, to this aerospace technology expertise and creativity, I also come with complementary experience in Information Technology -- fast-paced, cost-constrained development of web-based community platforms. Thirdly, during the transition between these two worlds I was lucky to be able to lead (or co-lead) 3 different startups targeting a variety of consumer electronics and information technology innovations. Though none of these three \"career intermission\" ventures proved sustainable, I've found my calling in business innovation and technology development, positioning me as an ideal candidate to judge the technological accomplishments of the innovative businesses spawned by the Google Lunar XPRIZE. I am now building an IT platform (BuildingEnergy.com) for an online community aggregating energy consumption data and reducing the carbon footprint of commercial buildings around the world. \n\nAs an example of an aerospace robotics accomplishment, I architected and managed the initial phases of the AWIMR space-walking robot program which requied me to overcome technical and political challenges comparable to a Lunar X-Prize mission. I negotiated the complex technical requirements and tangled political environment of space R&D in competition and collaboration with universities (MIT), small business (VACCO Industries), government labs (JPL), and government agencies (NASA HQ), all within the complex political environment of a presidential directive (Exploration Initiative) and organizational reshuffling. And this project was one of many in 13 years of contributions to space robotics technology as Responsible Deign Engineer, Control System Engineer, Principal Investigator, Project Manager, and ultimately Section Head and Program Manager.  I developed and patented state of the art systems as wide ranging as RF antenna pointing mechanisms that exceeded the state of the art. I engineered spacecraft navigation and control systems that pushed the envelope of what was considered possible at the time. And I contributed to or oversaw the production of mechanical systems such as reaction wheels, inertial measurement units, control moment gyroscopes whos life in the space environment has already exceed their design goals. I also contributed key technical guidance in the development of star trackers, laser communication terminal optics, a laser power beaming system, in-space manufacturing, docking mechanisms, high precision and high speed robotic systems, and space-walking locomotion. I even discovered the solution to a vexing problem that helped save a tumbling satellite that was given up for lost due to a launch vehicle failure.\n\nI have yet to meet a technological problem that I cannot ultimately fully grasp and excerise good judgement about to help prioritize resources and effort. I'm certain the challenge of being an objective, inciteful, prescient Lunar XPRIZE judge is well within my capability.\n\n3.In order to assess ITAR and other nationality based security issues, please indicate which country or countries in which you have citizenship or permanent residency.\n\nI am a citizen of the United States and have managed international contracts restricted by ITAR regulation\n\n4.Do you have any other comments that you would like the judges panel to take into account when assessing your application? (Maximum 200 words)\n\nRelative to my other professional commitments, a position as a Lunar XPRIZE judge would have the greatest potential for the advancement of humanity. If selected, it would become my top professional priority. I would exercise my responsabilities with clear-headed scientific acumen and endeavor to capitalize on the generosity and farsightedness of Google's contribution to the XPRIZE foundation. \n\n\nOn Mon, Jun 3, 2013 at 2:43 PM, Hobson Lane <hobsonlane@gmail.com> wrote:\n\n    Google Lunar XPRIZE Judges - Be Part of Space History!\n    Create Profile   \n    Administrative Stuff   \n    Online Interview   \n    Done!   \n    Congratulations!\n    Your initial responses indicate that you match well with the hiring manager's needs.
